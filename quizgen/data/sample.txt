Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. In chloroplasts, chlorophyll absorbs photons and initiates a chain of reactions that split water, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The light-dependent reactions generate ATP and NADPH, which serve as energy carriers. In the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is fixed into organic molecules, eventually producing glucose. Environmental factors such as light intensity, temperature, and carbon dioxide concentration influence the rate of photosynthesis. When light is limited, the process slows, while excessive heat can disrupt enzymes involved in the reactions. Understanding photosynthesis is essential for improving crop yields and addressing climate change through carbon sequestration.
